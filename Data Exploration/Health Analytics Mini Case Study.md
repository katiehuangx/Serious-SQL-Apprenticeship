## 📚 Business Questions
Before we start digging into the SQL script - let’s cover the business questions that we need to help the GM answer!

- How many unique users exist in the logs dataset?
- How many total measurements do we have per user on average?
- What about the median number of measurements per user?
- How many users have 3 or more measurements?
- How many users have 1,000 or more measurements?

Looking at the logs data - what is the number and percentage of the active user base who:
- Have logged blood glucose measurements?
- Have at least 2 types of measurements?
- Have all 3 measures - blood glucose, weight and blood pressure?

For users that have blood pressure measurements:
- What is the median systolic/diastolic blood pressure values?
